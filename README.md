**Learning Git**

This repository contains a list of files and demo projects I'm using to master Git and GitHub concepts, taken from the Udemy course 'Git Complete: The Definitive, Step-by-Step Guide to Git' by Jason Taylor.

As I learn more, you'll see the repository continue to grow to show evidence of my expanding version control skill set.
