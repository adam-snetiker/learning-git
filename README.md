# Learning Git

## What is This?
This repository contains a collection of course notes, resources, and my certificate of completion from Udemy. I recently completely **Git Complete: The Definitive, Step by Step Guide to Git** by Jason Taylor and will refer back to this repository many times over the course of my studies, projects, and eventually on the job. Feel free to look at any of my notes if you're new to Git and save the commands for your own use.
